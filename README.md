# Project: Spicy AI Content Creator Course Website

This project package contains all the necessary files for the "Spicy AI Content Creator Course" website, from documentation to a fully interactive prototype.

## How to Navigate This Project

1.  **Start with `index.html`**: This is the main hub page that links to all other parts of the project.
2.  **Explore Documentation**: The `docs/` directory contains markdown files explaining the project's goals, requirements, and user flows.
3.  **Review Wireframes**: The `wireframes/` directory provides low-fidelity HTML mockups of the site's structure.
4.  **Interact with the Prototype**: The `prototype/` directory contains a high-fidelity, clickable website prototype built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
